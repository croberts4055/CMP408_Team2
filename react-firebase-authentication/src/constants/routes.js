//In this file we are creating the routes path for different react pages 
//here you can add different pages for example home, about, log in, sign up
//account and many more just by following this pattern.

/*
Each route represents a page in your application. For instance,
 the sign up page should be reachable in development mode via
  http://localhost:3000/signup and in production mode
   via http://yourdomain/signup. Letâ€™s walk through the routes step by step.
